# simple-server

This is a simple server, written in JavaScript, for node.js. You'll need to have a recent version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed.

To run the server, first clone this repository to your computer:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zamfi/simple-server.git
```

Then, install the dependencies (other libraries that the server needs to run:

```
$ npm install
```

Lastly, run the server itself:

```
$ node server.js
```

This server will serve any files in the `public/` folder. Change what's in `public` to change what is served!
